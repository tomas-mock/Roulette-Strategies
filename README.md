# Roulette Strategies Simulation and Analysis ðŸŽ°

## Description
This project explores the effectiveness of various roulette betting strategies through simulation and statistical analysis using **R**. By modeling roulette outcomes and applying multiple betting strategies, the project evaluates their potential for profitability, risks, and statistical patterns. The findings were presented in a comprehensive report and visualized to highlight key insights.

## Features
- **Simulation of Roulette Outcomes**: A robust model replicates roulette spins and tracks results for different strategies.
- **Betting Strategies Analyzed**:
  - **Single Number Bet**: High-risk, high-reward strategy.
  - **Red/Black Bet**: Lower risk with even-odds returns.
  - **James Bond Strategy**: Combines multiple bets for a spread risk approach.
  - **D'Alembert Strategy**: A progressive betting strategy to mitigate losses.
- **Statistical Evaluation**: In-depth analysis of success rates, average earnings, and risk factors for each strategy.
- **Visualized Findings**: Charts and graphs provide a clear depiction of outcomes and comparisons.
